Nope. Not at all. I’m sure you’ll get good results on scientific and mathematical articles but history, especially Turkish history. Oh boy. I want to give you a specific case study, and explain why it is so difficult to remove the biases.

Critics say AI makes bias worse
Since AI was first deployed in hiring, loan approval, insurance premium modeling, facial recognition, law enforcement, and a range of other applications, critics (with considerable reason) have pointed to the technology's biased tendencies.

For example, Google's new language model BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a leading natural language processing (NLP) model that developers can use to build their own AI. BERT was originally built using Wikipedia text as its primary source. Is there anything wrong with this? Wikipedia's contributors are overwhelmingly white males from Europe and North America. Therefore, one of the most important sources of language-based AI was biased in its inception.

Similar problems have been found in computer vision, another key area of AI development. The facial recognition dataset contains hundreds of thousands of labeled faces, which is critical for developing facial recognition applications for cybersecurity, law enforcement, and even customer service. However, it turns out that the developers (probably mostly white middle-aged men) are unknowingly better at achieving accuracy for people like them. Women, children, seniors, and people of color have much higher error rates than middle-aged white men. 

What if AI is actually part of the bias solution?
However, a better understanding of the phenomenon of AI bias suggests that AI simply exposes and amplifies implicit biases that already exist but are ignored or misunderstood. AI itself is not affected by color, gender, age, and other biases. It is less susceptible to the logical fallacies and cognitive biases that plague humans. The only reason we see AI biased is that humans sometimes train it with heuristic errors and biased data." , [Nobel Prize] Only half an hour after winning the award, the introduction page Wikipedia was bombarded with sexism (www-hk01-com.translate.goog) :

Another accusation that Wikipedia and Wikiversity is under peer-pressure-bias.

https://wikiindex.org/Abd_Lomax:"
However, the 800 lb gorilla, the English Wikipedia, was naive about consensus process and the community did not realize that it is far from 'quick'. That is, the basic operation of the wiki could indeed be quick, ad hoc, and it was not surprising that this worked as well as it did. However, for the project to be NPOV (express a neutral point of view), genuine consensus process was needed. Outside of narrow circumstances where high consensus is relatively natural, this requires deep discussion and often skilled facilitation.
