About ETFDailyNews.com

Our goal is simple…to help investors enjoy more investment success through the unique benefits of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).

We accomplish this vital mission in 2 key ways.

1) Focus on the SMART Grades

This is our exclusive ETF ratings system which analyzes each fund based on 4 different measures of its attractiveness. In the end it finds the most timely ETFs ready to outperform. Here are links to the top SMART Grades resources on the site:

    A-List of Strong Buy ETFs
    Upgrades/Downgrades
    ETF Category Rankings
    About the SMART Grades

2) Expert Commentary

ETFDailyNews.com is headed by Steve Reitmeister (but most everyone calls him “Reity”). He has over 40 years of investing experience including nearly 20 years leading Zacks.com, which has helped millions of investors find a path to outperformance.

Reity is the visionary behind what you find on ETFDailyNews.com.  He wanted investors to have a focused and uncluttered experience. This reduction in “Information Overload” leads to increased investment success by spending more of your time on the things that matter. Such as the best ETFs stemming from a proven model like the SMART Grades. And narrowing down commentary to what is truly essential to get you on the right path.

Steve also shares his in-depth market commentary and hand selected picks in the Reitmeister Total Return portfolio."

ETF Daily News is the #1 source for daily headlines helping you to make informed decisions about Exchange Traded Funds. You will find a wealth of information in our archives, and can search for keywords targeting articles relevant to you."

From https://www.aaii.com/journal/article/etfdailynewscom , ETFDailyNews.com is a website that provides users one source for daily headlines and information on exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The site contains an abundance of information on ETFs, including thorough information on specific ETFs, basic educational resources and more than 10 articles published daily.
ETF Daily News is not an investment adviser, and the content of the site is not an endorsement to buy or sell any securities. Rather, it is a resource for investors to learn more about ETFs and stay current with developments within the sector.
An essential part of the website is the Basics tab. This section provides readers with articles that will help them learn more about the benefits of investing in ETFs and how they work. Article categories include Why ETFs, Popular ETFs, How ETFs Work, Tax Advantages and many more. Clicking on any of the links in this section will take you to ETF Daily News’ sister site, ETFzone.com, which also provides extensive education sources on the subject.
ETFDailyNews.com
ETFDailyNews
 
On the left-hand side of the site, users can search through ETF articles based on class, such as: bond, commodity, currency, regional or a wide variety of sectors.
The ETF Screener is a highlight of the site; it is a free tool that searches and analyzes all ETFs currently traded in the U.S. You can search based on the issuer, the leverage, type, asset type, asset size, whether the fund is diversified or optionable, its expense ratio or total assets. All ETFs that pass a particular screen can then be further analyzed by clicking on them. The next screen shows pricing data, an overview of the fund as well as all related news articles. Charts that are provided include simple line, intraday, candlestick, directional bar and high/low/close. Each chart can be redrawn to show one-day, five-day, three-month, six-month, one-year, five-year and 10-year data.
The Fundamentals tab shows performance, fees and expenses, valuation, dividend and volatility of the fund. Technical information is also provided regarding the momentum, support and resistance, and stochastic oscillator of the fund.
The New tab has a link for a launch center, which displays a list of the most recently launched ETFs, and also a filing center which shows a list of the most recently proposed ETFs.
ETF Daily News is a relatively new site, but what we’ve seen so far has been very useful. This site is a wonderful tool for investors to learn about ETFs and also keep up to date on recent ETF news. Viewers can sign up for a free newsletter titled Global ETF

Paul is the Co-Founder and CEO of ETF Daily Bews. For over 20 years, Paul has dedicated his life to the markets — initially as as highly successful full-time trader, then as a market analyst, pundit, author, and entrepreneur.

In 2008, Paul co-founded Dividend.com, which quickly became the #1 dividend-focused website in history (where it still firmly stands today). Paul’s daily newsletter reached hundreds of thousands of investors and advisors who considered it a “must-read” part of their daily investing routine. Paul also developed the DARS™ Rating System to rate and rank dividend stocks. Dividend.com was later acquired by Mitre Media in 2012.

Paul’s work has appeared on Forbes.com, TheStreet.com, Nasdaq.com, AOL Money, Yahoo! Finance, Google Finance, and many other top market sites. In 2011, Paul was recommended by personal finance legend Suze Orman, both on her weekly television show as well as in her best-selling book, The Money Class.

Tom Reese, COO

Tom is the Co-Founder and COO of ETF Daily News. He’s spent the last 20 years as a web developer, and the past nearly 10 years as a finance writer and analyst.

In 2008, Tom co-founded Dividend.com with Paul Rubillo. He served as the site’s Editor-in-Chief for four years, and then after the company’s acquisition by Mitre Media, Tom served as Mitre’s Director of Product & Marketing for three years. Tom also authored the Dividend Advisor newsletter from its inception in April 2014 through March 2015.


You can find Tom’s work all over the financial web, in the form of hard-hitting articles as well as industry-leading tools, pages, and much more."

"Privacy Policy And Disclaimer

Privacy Policy:

Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of the operation of our site, we gather certain types of information about our users, and we would like to explain the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how to correct or change the information.

Information Collected by This Site

We collect two types of personally identifying information from users: personal data (such as names and e-mail addresses); and aggregated data (such as information about traffic patterns on the site, for example how many users log into the site on a daily basis).

Personal Data

Personal data is collected when users provide personal data to the site. For example in registering for email notification services, answering surveys, purchasing items from the site, sending email to the site, registering for contests and other promotional opportunities, message boards and chat areas.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.

We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit networkadvertising.org.

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children (defined herein as minors younger than 13 years of age) without obtaining parental consent. Before registering for an account to use the services of the Web site, we ask that all minors have their parents read our Privacy Policy. Before and during the registration process, we encourage all minors to include a parent or guardian in the process.

Aggregate Data

When visitors come to the Web site, we collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages were visited, and which hyperlinks were “clicked.” Collecting such information involves the logging of IP addresses, operating system and browser software used by each visitor to the Web site.

The non-personally identifiable information we collect helps us diagnose problems with our server, administer the Web site, identify the most popular areas of the Web site, and determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities. In addition, we may disclose some of this information to advertisers to inform them of the number of people who have seen and/or clicked through their advertisements.

Who this data may be shared with

Our site uses both the personal and aggregated information collected for multiple purposes. The information is used to improve the content of the site, to customize the content and/or layout of the site for each individual user and to notify users about updates to the site or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you.

We share aggregated information collected from the site with third parties for both advertising and promotional purposes. We also provide statistical information based on this data to advertisers and other current and potential business partners. ...

Cookies

Our site also uses “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that most major websites write into your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow a website to measure activity on their site and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, thus allowing you to visit various member-only parts of the site without re-registering. We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except for personal information voluntarily provided by you (i.e. during membership registration or a contest), we do not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, and that information is not shared with third parties.

You may occasionally get cookies from advertisers on the site, which is standard on the Internet. These cookies are outside the control of our site, and are not subject to our privacy policy. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you’d prefer, you may be able to set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the site, such as the member-only areas and shopping, contest and game areas, will not function properly if you do so."

Analysis/Bias: They seem to publish EFTs and center. They changed their page in the few years and I couldn't find a record finding explictly about their financial incomes nor ownership shares. Yet maybe the author page and that most of articles are posted by MarketBeat leads to somewhere. Or contacting them.
