Way 1: Press always "Agree" with Auto-Clicker. There's an authoritarian-right bias and reverse in my observation.
Way 2: Switch to "Agree" and "Disagree" permanently and/or reject "Values" so, that the title goes bigger. Once Anti-Centrism is reached, all Ideology-Balls are 100% contented in my experience.
Way 3: Figuring out what the Ideology-Balls individually appeals due changes in four axis.
Way 4: Making way 3 easier with using kamikaze till one ball stands.
Way 5: Use "Surveillance", "De*** Flights"/"Re-directive Institutional Facility" and "Personality Cult/Liberation Rally" till sameness among the balls are reached.
Way 6: Pressing "Meh" always till turning to "Radical Centrism" and "Reform" the country every round (except warfare).
Way 7: Depends on thinking that refusing to progress the game fits the definition too.
