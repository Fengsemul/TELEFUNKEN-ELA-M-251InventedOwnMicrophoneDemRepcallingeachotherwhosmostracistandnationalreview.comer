Kanye West referred to his own microphone by "very microphone I use", I guess: “Well, I see good things about Hitler also,” said West. “I love everyone, and Jewish people are not going to tell me, ‘You can love us and you can love what we’re doing to you with the contracts, and you can love what we’re pushing with the pornography.’ But this guy that invented highways and invented the very microphone I use as a musician, you can’t say out loud that this person ever did anything good and I’m done with that. I’m done with the classifications.” https://torontosun.com/news/local-news/warmington-bnai-brith-canada-says-kayne-wests-love-of-hitler-and-nazis-harmful-and-offensive

first highway: "So who invented the highway? Well, depending on your definition of a highway, that honor goes to the MESOPOTAMIANS, who invented the first paved roads in 4000 BC. The first modern road was developed by Scottish engineers Thomas Telford and John Loudon McAdam, but that was YEARS before the first road with tar on top was created. That honor goes to the Champs-Élysées in Paris in 1824. The first national road was a U.S. construction creatively named “The National Road,” and was completed in 1834." https://www.themarysue.com/did-hitler-invent-the-microphone-and-highways-kanye-wests-claims-explained/

Dan Panneton, a director at the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies ,agrees.

“FSWC is disgusted and horrified by the repugnant statements made by Ye expressing support for Adolf Hitler and explicitly denying the Holocaust, but we are not surprised,” he said. “Ye has repeatedly made anti-Semitic, racist, and other hateful statements in recent months, which considering his enormous platform, threatens the safety and well-being of the Jewish and other vulnerable communities.”

“(West’s) music (is) still carried on all major platforms, Twitter owner Elon Musk allowed him back on the platform, and he was recently given an audience with former President of the United States Donald Trump,” but Panneton hopes “his Nazi-worship, Holocaust denial, and affiliation with fascists will put the final nail in his ability to spread such vile hatred.”

Then, after Trump questioned the bias of a judge because of his Mexican heritage, Ryan called the comment “racist” but did not disavow his candidate. https://c2cjournal.ca/2016/06/how-conservatism-can-survive-trumpism/

also one republican source:
But another big reason is that the amount of offense that is taken is often directly inverse to how important you are to the Democratic Party at that moment. https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/why-joe-biden-gets-away-with-making-offensive-statements/

https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/why-joe-biden-gets-away-with-making-offensive-statements/ critic: "binary choice where the person must be fired or canceled or not." It's three choices (consisting three parts of choices elements) because of physical time in this context of current controversy forcing us to have a situational result/effect from every of our actions like pushing a guy refusing to go any path straight-forwards. Choosing nothing is voting the Status Quo, giving others the power.

Jim Geraghty writes mostly about the main speech topic in Biden’s speech: "How Should We Remember Gorbachev?" yet the Biden-topic is covered one-third of their own article titled "Why Joe Biden Gets Away with Making Offensive Statements" and only one sentence is answered why "But another big reason is that the amount of offense that is taken is often directly inverse to how important you are to the Democratic Party at that moment.". Although even this got miscategorized with "There are a lot of reasons we shouldn’t embrace cancel culture." even if it responds to "Why Joe Biden Gets Away..." It sould be like:"The reason why Biden..." to seperate with the reason-list of negative effects of cancel culture.
