Kanye West referred to his own microphone by "very microphone I use", I guess: “Well, I see good things about Hitler also,” said West. “I love everyone, and Jewish people are not going to tell me, ‘You can love us and you can love what we’re doing to you with the contracts, and you can love what we’re pushing with the pornography.’ But this guy that invented highways and invented the very microphone I use as a musician, you can’t say out loud that this person ever did anything good and I’m done with that. I’m done with the classifications.” https://torontosun.com/news/local-news/warmington-bnai-brith-canada-says-kayne-wests-love-of-hitler-and-nazis-harmful-and-offensive

first highway: "So who invented the highway? Well, depending on your definition of a highway, that honor goes to the MESOPOTAMIANS, who invented the first paved roads in 4000 BC. The first modern road was developed by Scottish engineers Thomas Telford and John Loudon McAdam, but that was YEARS before the first road with tar on top was created. That honor goes to the Champs-Élysées in Paris in 1824. The first national road was a U.S. construction creatively named “The National Road,” and was completed in 1834." https://www.themarysue.com/did-hitler-invent-the-microphone-and-highways-kanye-wests-claims-explained/

“FSWC is disgusted and horrified by the repugnant statements made by Ye expressing support for Adolf Hitler and explicitly denying the Holocaust, but we are not surprised,” he said. “Ye has repeatedly made anti-Semitic, racist, and other hateful statements in recent months, which considering his enormous platform, threatens the safety and well-being of the Jewish and other vulnerable communities.”

“(West’s) music (is) still carried on all major platforms, Twitter owner Elon Musk allowed him back on the platform, and he was recently given an audience with former President of the United States Donald Trump,” but Panneton hopes “his Nazi-worship, Holocaust denial, and affiliation with fascists will put the final nail in his ability to spread such vile hatred.”

But another big reason is that the amount of offense that is taken is often directly inverse to how important you are to the Democratic Party at that moment. https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/why-joe-biden-gets-away-with-making-offensive-statements/

https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/why-joe-biden-gets-away-with-making-offensive-statements/ critic: "binary choice where the person must be fired or canceled or not." It's three choices (consisting three parts of choices elements) because of physical time in this context of current controversy forcing us to have a situational result/effect from every of our actions like pushing a guy refusing to go any path straight-forwards. Choosing nothing is voting the Status Quo, giving others the power.

Jim Geraghty writes mostly about the main speech topic in Biden’s speech: "How Should We Remember Gorbachev?" yet the Biden-topic is covered one-third of their own article titled "Why Joe Biden Gets Away with Making Offensive Statements" and only one sentence is answered why "But another big reason is that the amount of offense that is taken is often directly inverse to how important you are to the Democratic Party at that moment.". Although even this got miscategorized with "There are a lot of reasons we shouldn’t embrace cancel culture." even if it responds to "Why Joe Biden Gets Away..." It sould be like:"The reason why Biden..." to seperate with the reason-list of negative effects of cancel culture.

“MYERS, ONCE WITH BRAVES, DOING AN ACT IN NO-MAN’S LAND – Sergt. John F. Hanley, a Pacific Coast ball player, who is overseas with the 322d Field Signal Corps, has written to a California friend this interesting gossip about “Hap” Myers, formerly with the Braves:

 “I suppose you remember Hap Myers, the old ball player of big league fame. Well, he is one of our number. Jim, if there was ever a card this bird is the best of all. Every day he pulls a new one on the big boys and don’t be surprised if Hap comes home with a commission under his hat.

 “His latest sketch was chasing a rabbit across No Man’s Land and catching [the] bunny in full view of the German front lines. He didn’t even have on a helmet or gas mask and how he ever got away with it beats me. After catching the rabbit he sold him to some major for 50 francs. And to show this officer he wasn’t particular with whom he ate, old Hap moved in for a little supper.

 “Hap and I were over to see a machine gun company and were surprised to discover it was Hank Gowdy’s bunch. He just missed Gowdy about five minutes.

 “I met Sharkey Corrigan, the kid that was playing second base for us up in Pittsburg. He is with some engineer’s outfit and he is quite a little trooper himself.” — Boston Globe, December 15, 1918:15.

 	【Expressway】Which country was born | the first highway?MJ Blondie 【MOTA】
In 1925, Mussolini, who became prime minister-turned-governor, opened a toll highway connecting Milan with the northern resort of the Lake District (around Como), which was the first highway in the world. By 1935, Mussolini had opened a 500-kilometer highway called the "Solar Road". ...

https://repforums.prosoundweb.com/index.php?topic=29068.0 : A while back you were quoted on NPR, discussing the Hitler Bottle Mic as marking a milestone transition in microphone capsule design, hence adding to the success of Hitler's overall image (at least sonically).

The reason I am interested is that I am taking a History class on the Third Reich and I would like to get more info about exactly what it was that made this mic stand out in terms of technology, and from the short piece I read it had to do with Georg Neumann finally figuring out how dynamics played in the equation whilst building a microphone diaphragm.

I know Hitler relied on a lot of propaganda to market his party and his overall image and I'm sure this mic provided a new way for him to reach new audiences en masse especially over the loudspeaker.  

Can you or anyone else point me to some links or sites where I can get some further information, other than the info you provided on the Peluso piece.  I am especially interested how this technology was different from prior to the Bottle and some more in depth historical perspective on the use of the new mic/technology.
