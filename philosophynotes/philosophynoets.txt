Some of its metaphysical underpinnings, however, have not been studied in detail yet.

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363747807_More_on_realism_phenomenology_and_causation_in_reply_to_Cheng : 2022-04-28 : "First, I agree with Cheng that the argument from illusions to indirect realism is controversial, especially as to what is meant by “realism,” “veridical,” and “sense data” and the background assumptions underlying them. I provide a finer specification of some of the sub-movements that were the specific concerns of my previous article, particularly phenomenology as it currently sees itself in perception research, and the relevance of illusions. Perception has turned out to be far more complex than traditional philosophy realized, as has been revealed by recent research in neuroscience and psychophysics. Lastly, I answer Cheng’s question about the “causal exclusion argument” by suggesting it is obviated by the temporal substructure of metaphysical states, and I provide a detailed supporting case in Supplementary Material ."

For example, mind-body relations are one-to-many in their event durations, which is not consistent with simple (efficient) causation between levels."

Realism	Objective. Exists independently of human thoughts and beliefs or knowledge of their existence (realist), but is interpreted through social conditioning (critical realist)"

The terms objectivity and realism are often used interchangeably in everyday discourse, yet they hold distinct meanings in philosophical and critical contexts.


Objectivity refers to the concept of perceiving and representing facts free from personal bias, emotions, or subjective interpretations. It is often discussed within the realm of knowledge and truth-finding processes, emphasizing an impartial standpoint that strives to see things as they are, not as one might wish them to be [Cambridge Dictionary].
Realism, in contrast, is a broader philosophical doctrine which posits that external reality exists independently of human thoughts or perceptions. Philosophical realism argues for the existence of an objective reality that human beings can know and understand [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].


Key Differences
Epistemological Focus: Objectivity primarily concerns methods of inquiry and the attitudinal stance of individuals towards facts, aiming for neutrality. Realism, however, is concerned with the nature of reality itself and the capacity of human knowledge to accurately reflect that reality.
Disciplinary Applications: Objectivity is commonly applied in sciences and journalism where methods and reporting strive to minimize bias [Nature]. Realism spans across various disciplines including art (depicting life accurately), literature (illusory reality in narrative forms), and sciences (the existence of phenomena independent of observation).


Conclusion
While objectivity and realism can interrelate—realism requiring a degree of objective analysis and objectivity often assuming a realist background—their cores diverge in philosophical significance. One deals with an ethical and methodological approach to information (objectivity), while the other tackles the foundational nature of existence and perception (realism).
