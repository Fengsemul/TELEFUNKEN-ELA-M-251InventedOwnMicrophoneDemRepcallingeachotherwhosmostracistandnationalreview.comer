Some of its metaphysical underpinnings, however, have not been studied in detail yet.

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363747807_More_on_realism_phenomenology_and_causation_in_reply_to_Cheng : 2022-04-28 : "First, I agree with Cheng that the argument from illusions to indirect realism is controversial, especially as to what is meant by “realism,” “veridical,” and “sense data” and the background assumptions underlying them. I provide a finer specification of some of the sub-movements that were the specific concerns of my previous article, particularly phenomenology as it currently sees itself in perception research, and the relevance of illusions. Perception has turned out to be far more complex than traditional philosophy realized, as has been revealed by recent research in neuroscience and psychophysics. Lastly, I answer Cheng’s question about the “causal exclusion argument” by suggesting it is obviated by the temporal substructure of metaphysical states, and I provide a detailed supporting case in Supplementary Material ."

The terms objectivity and realism are often used interchangeably in everyday discourse, yet they hold distinct meanings in philosophical and critical contexts.


Objectivity refers to the concept of perceiving and representing facts free from personal bias, emotions, or subjective interpretations. It is often discussed within the realm of knowledge and truth-finding processes, emphasizing an impartial standpoint that strives to see things as they are, not as one might wish them to be [Cambridge Dictionary].
Realism, in contrast, is a broader philosophical doctrine which posits that external reality exists independently of human thoughts or perceptions. Philosophical realism argues for the existence of an objective reality that human beings can know and understand [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].


Key Differences
Epistemological Focus: Objectivity primarily concerns methods of inquiry and the attitudinal stance of individuals towards facts, aiming for neutrality. Realism, however, is concerned with the nature of reality itself and the capacity of human knowledge to accurately reflect that reality.
Disciplinary Applications: Objectivity is commonly applied in sciences and journalism where methods and reporting strive to minimize bias [Nature]. Realism spans across various disciplines including art (depicting life accurately), literature (illusory reality in narrative forms), and sciences (the existence of phenomena independent of observation).


Conclusion
While objectivity and realism can interrelate—realism requiring a degree of objective analysis and objectivity often assuming a realist background—their cores diverge in philosophical significance. One deals with an ethical and methodological approach to information (objectivity), while the other tackles the foundational nature of existence and perception (realism).

https://megalodon.jp/2024-0624-0520-23/https://web.ics.purdue.edu:443/~mjacovid/Representation.pdf : "Pendlebury argues for the narrower thesis that
experiences represent propositions. If any of these arguments succeeded, it would follow that I
am mistaken and experiences are representational events. 
Pendlebury first argues (224-25) that sense experience must represent propositions on the
grounds that otherwise we could not make sense of sensible judgments such as “these sense
experiences support (or: do not support) this belief” and “these sense experiences are consistent
(or: inconsistent) with those beliefs.” If this were a good argument," , "Pendlebury (224) thinks that it is important that philosophers call experiences ‘veridical’
and ‘non-veridical’ and concludes that this means that experiences can be true or false. But
20
experiences cannot be true or false, not really.14
 If calling experiences ‘veridical’ and ‘nonveridical’ means anything, it means that they incline us to believe true propositions or false
propositions. The terminology is misleading insofar as it suggests that there is a single
proposition associated with each experience. " , "Later, Pendlebury (225) concludes that experiences represent propositions from the fact
that “Philosophers of Perception and Epistemologists take for granted . . . . that sense
experiences are the sorts of things which can be accepted and rejected.” This also seems to be a
misleading way of talking. Suppose I watch a magician appear to saw a woman in half. I don’t
want to reject my experience of watching the trick. I may have paid good money to see that
trick. Rather, I want to reject the belief that the experience inclines me to have, the belief that
the magician is actually sawing a woman in half. Experiences incline us to accept beliefs
without thereby representing those beliefs.",
"Experiences ordinarily so-called are the pieces into which we carve up our days. 
They are sources of memory, wisdom, and happiness. And they do not represent anything"

Pendlebury's understanding of "Sense Experience": https://megalodon.jp/2024-0624-0536-58/https://www.jstor.org:443/stable/4545057 : "Sense Experience" "Perception always involves representation, and in the standard case the vehicle of perceptual representation is a sense of experience. In normal perception in other words, a sense experience is what does the representing, it is not something that is represented. A sense experience, moreover, is not something that is represented. a sense experience, moreover, is not and does not involve a special kind of thing such as a sense datum to which we are related by some mysterious relation of 'having' or 'sensing'. It is, rather, an event which inheres in a perceiver"--"a happening in his sensuous and mental life. It may be complex"/duration/changing/other sense exp. as parts -- "as the total exp" "I now have includes visual, aural, and tactile exp" "and as the visual exp"
Pendlebury's commonsense realism: https://philpapers.org/rec/PENPAO-6 ; https://megalodon.jp/2024-0624-0548-58/https://www.bu.edu:443/wcp/IntroV5.htm (2000) : "We do however enjoy unproblematic access to sense data. Hence our direct awareness of sense experience is the only genuinely relational awareness that "includes within itself one of its relata." This awareness eliminates the specter of an infinite regress in the process of justification. To this argument one might object that the notion of sense data seems to a hybrid concept that conflates descriptive and explanatory motifs. If we limit ourselves to description of our experience, it seems that we are in fact simply not aware of sense data. We are aware of pained bodily parts and red things but not of pain or red tout court. Michael Pendlebury contends that the development of a sophisticated common sense realism requires an account of how perceptions become perceptual judgments "to the extent that they are imbedded in and engaged with the high level patterns of consciousness and reasoning characteristic of judgments." He rightly points out that whatever may be the relations between concepts in a conceptual system the applicability of concepts must be "anchored" in the nonconceptual aspects of perceptual experience. Human perceptions always blend conceptual and nonconceptual aspects. To the extent that they include conceptual aspects perceptions are raised into what Wilfred Sellars called "the space of reasons" and thus become perceptual judgments. Pendlebury develops a convincing account of how perceptual discriminations both found and merge with conceptual articulations."
